added abortTick = time to fertilize egg, if abortTick > bornTick - can always fertilize
added eggsize 1 = 100%, if 0 eggsize - pawn can hold unlimited eggs
eggs were reweighted according to hatchling size, in human language that means less eggs than random number it used to be, bigger movement debuffs and big eggs wont even fit in pawns without propper training and/or some operations

1.9.7b
fix for futa chances

1.9.7a
Zaltys:
[FIX] Corrected the trait checking for Vigorous quirk.

[FIX] Fixed a major compatibility bug when using Psychology with RJW.
[FIX] Sapiosexual quirk fix for players who aren't using Consolidated Traits mod.
[COMPATIBILITY] Pawn sexuality is synced with other mods during character generation if the player is using Psychology or Individuality. (Instead of the old method of syncing it when the game starts.)

1.9.7
Settings and fixes
Skömer:

[FEATURE] Archotech parts (penis, vagina, breasts, anus).
DegenerateMuffalo:

[COMPATIBILITY] Compatibility with "Babies and Children" mod, hopefully with "CnP" as well. Fixes CnP bug with arrested kids
Zaltys:

[CORE] Moved Datastore to PawnData, since that's the only place it is used.
[CORE] New method in PregnancyHelper for checking whether impregnation is possible.
[CORE] Replaced Mod_Settings with RJWSettings.
[FIX] Fixed Breed job.

[FIX] Fixed NymphJoininBed not triggering if the nymph is already in the same bed with the target (which is often the case with spouses).
[FEATURE] New less cluttered settings windows, with sliders where applicable.
[FEATURE] Pawn sexuality. Imported from Rational Romance, Psychology, or Individuality if those are in use. Otherwise rolled randomly by RJW. Can be viewed from the RJW infocard (Bio-tab).
[FEATURE] New settings for enabling STDs, rape, cum, and RJW-specific sounds. Also included settings for clothing preferences during sex, rape alert sounds, fertility age, and sexuality spread (if not using RR/Psychology/Individuality).
[FEATURE] Added a re-roller for pawn sexuality, accessible from the info card. If the sexuality is inherited from another mod, this only re-rolls the quirks. Only available during pawn generation, unless you're playing in developer mode.
[FEATURE] Added new optional setting to enable complex calculation of interspecies impregnation. Species of similar body type and size have high chance of impregnation, while vastly different species are close to zero.
[FEATURE] Added fertility toggle for archotech penis/vagina, accessible from the infocard (through bio-tab).
[FEATURE] New random quirk: Vigorous. Lowers tiredness from sex and reduces minimum time between lovin', not available to pawns with Sickly trait. Animals can also have this quirk.

Ed86:

*no idea how to add gags and not conflict with hairs hats and stuff, and i have little interest in wasting half day on that, so they stay invisible

bdsm gear now has colors based on what its made of
increase armbinder flamability 0.3->0.5
[bug?] game generates gear ignoring recipe, so bdsm gear most likely need own custom stuff category filters and harmony patching, not sure if its worth effort

Designators changes:
-masochists can be designated for comforting
-zoophiles can be designated for breeding
-or wildmode

fixed ignoring age and other conditions for sex under certain settings
fixed submitting pawn, "submitting" hediff ends and pawn can run away breaking sex, so when pawn is "submitting", hediff will be reaplied each time new pawns rapes it

fixed that mess of pregnancy above
fix for broken settings and auto disable animal rape cp if bestiality disabled

[FIX] Re-enabled animal-on-animal.
[FIX] Animals can now actually rape comfort prisoners, if that setting is enabled. The range is limited to what that they can see, animals don't seek out targets like the humanlikes do. (My bad, I did all of the job testing with the console, and forgot to add it to the think trees.)
[COMPATIBILITY] Fixed the Enslaved check for Simple Slavery.

Ed86:
[CORE] Renamed the bestiality setting for clarity.
fixed broken jobdriver

1.9.6a
fix for pregnancy

1.9.6
Zaltys:
[CORE] Added manifest for Mod Manager.
[CORE] Added more support for the sexuality tracker.
[CORE] Moved some things to new SexUtility class, xxx was getting too cluttered.
[CORE] Added a new method for scaling alien age to human age. This makes it easier to fix races that have broken lifespans in their racedefs.
[FIX] Pawn sexuality icon was overlapping the icon from Individuality mod during pawn generation. Moved it a bit. Please leave feedback if it still overlaps with mod-added stuff.
[FIX] Enabled whore price checking during pawn generation.
[FIX] Female masturbation wasn't generating fluids.
[FIX] Clarified some of the setting tooltip texts.
[FIX] Added text fixes to fellatio, for species that have a beak..
[BALANCE] Permanent disfiguring injuries (such as scars) lower the whore price.
[BALANCE] Rapist trait gain now occurs slightly slower on average.
[FEATURE] Pawns now have a chance of cleaning up after themselves when they've done masturbating. Affected by traits: higher probability for Industrious/Hard Worker, lower for Lazy/Slothful/Depressive. Pawns who are incapable of Cleaning never do it. Also added the same cleaning check for whoring (some whores will clean after the customer, some expect others to do it.)
[FEATURE] Added a few pawn-specific quirks such as foot fetish, increased fertility, teratophilia (attraction to monsters/disfigured), and endytophilia (clothed sex). Quirks have minor effects, and cover fetishes and paraphilias that don't have large enough impact on the gameplay to be implemented as actual traits. You can check if your pawns have any quirks by using the new icon in the Bio-tab, the effects are listed in the tooltip. Some quirks are also available to animals.
[FEATURE] Added glow to the icon, which shows up if the pawn has quirks. For convenience, so you can tell at a glance when rerolling and checking enemies. (Current icons are placeholders, but work well enough for now.)
[FEATURE] Added a new job that allows pawns to find a secluded spot for a quick fap if frustrated. (...or not so secluded if they have the Exhibitionist quirk). The job is available to everyone, including visitors and even idle enemies. This should allow most pawns to keep frustration in check while away from home, etc.
[COMPATIBILITY] Rimworld of Magic - shapeshifted/polymorphed pawns should now be able to have sex soon after transformation.
[COMPATIBILITY] Added conditionals to the trait patches, they should now work with mods that alter traits.
[COMPATIBILITY] Lord of the Rims: The Third Age - genitalia are working now, but the mod removes other defs that RJW needs and may not be fully compatible.

Note: Requires new save. Sorry about that. The good news is that the groundwork is largely done, so this shouldn't happen again anytime soon.

Ed86:
disabled ability to set designators for comfortprisoner raping and bestiality for colonists and animals
comfort raping and bestiality designators can be turned on for prisoners and slaves from simple slavery

added option to spawn genderless pawns as futas
changed descriptions to dna inheritance
changed all that pos code from patch pregnancy, to use either rjw pregnancies or vanilla shit code
added animal-animal pregnancies(handled through rjw bestiality)

added Restraints(no one has suppiled decent name) hediff, insects will restrain non same faction pawn after egging them, easily removed with any medicine

changed incubator to quirk, incubator naw affect only egg pregnancy
added breeder quirk - same as incubator but for non eggs, needs only 10 births for humans or 20 for animals

v1.9.5b
fix for hemipenis and croc operations

Zaltys:
[CORE] More sprite positioning work. sexTick can be called with enablerotation: false to disable the default 'face each other' position.
[CORE] Figured out a simple way to hide pawn clothing during sex, without any chance of it being lost. Added parameters to the sexTick method to determine if the pawn/partner should be drawn nude, though at the moment everything defaults to nude. If a job breaks, may result in the pawn getting stuck nude for a short while, until the game refreshes clothing.
[BALANCE] Added age modifier for whore prices.
[FEATURE] Added a new info card for RJW-related stats. Accessible from the new icon in the Bio tab. Very bare-bones at the moment, the only thing it shows for now is the price range for whoring. Will be expanded in later updates.

v1.9.5a
fix for pregnancy error
mod menu rearangement
fix? for hololock crafting with CE
"ComplexFurniture" research requirement for for whore beds

v1.9.5
Fix for mechanoid 'rape' and implanting.
[FIX] Corpse violation was overloading to the wrong method in some cases, causing errors. Fixed.
[FIX] Nymphomaniac trait was factored multiple times for sex need. Removed the duplicate, adjusted sex drive increase from the trait itself to compensate.
[FIX] Other modifications to the sex need calculations. Age was factored in twice.
[CORE] Added basic positioning code to JobDriver_GettinRaped. Pawns should now usually have sex face-to-face or from behind, instead of in completely random position.
[BALANCE] Made necrophilia much rarer for pawns without the trait.
[BALANCE] Made zoophilia rarer for pawns without the trait, and made non-zoos pickier about the targets (unless frustrated).
[BALANCE] Adjusted the whore prices. Males were getting paid far less, made it more even. Added more trait adjustments. As before, Greedy/Beautiful pawns still get the best prices, and the bedroom quality (and privacy) affects the price a lot.
[BALANCE] Soliciting for customers now slightly increases Social XP.
[BALANCE] Higher Social skill slightly improves the chance of successful solicitation.
[BALANCE] Sexually frustrated customers are more likely to accept.
[FEATURE] Converted the old whore beds into regular furniture (since whores can use any bed nowadays), for more furniture variety. The old luxury whore bed is now a slightly less expensive version of a royal bed, and the whore sleeping spot is now an improved version that's between a sleeping spot and the normal low-tier bed in effectiveness: quick and cheap to build. Better than sleeping on floor and useful in early game, but you probably want to upgrade to regular bed as soon as possible. Descriptions and names may need further work.
[FEATURE] Added 69 as a new sex type. Cannot result in pregnancy, obviously. Frequency modifiable in settings, as usual.

v1.9.4c
insect eggs kill off other pregnancies
pawns cant get pregnancies while having eggs
fix for non futa female rapin vulrability check
added 1h cooldown heddif to enemy rapist, so job wont dump errors and freeze pawn/game
added a bunch of animal and insect checks, so rape enemy shouldnt trigger if those options disabled
made/separated enemyrapeByhumanlikes, like other classes

v1.9.4b
fix for rape enemy, so it wont rape while enemies around

v1.9.4a
fix for rape enemy not raping

v1.9.4
Zaltys:
[FIX] Extended the list of jobs that can be interrupted by whores, this should make whores considerably more active.
[FIX] Animals with non-standard life-stages were not considered valid targets for various jobs. Fixed by adding a check for lifestage reproductiveness.
[FIX] Engaging in lovin' with partners that have minimal sex ability (such as corpses) could result in the pawn getting no satisfaction at all, causing them to be permanently stuck at frustrated. Fixed by adding a minimum. (Humpshroom addiction can still result in zero satisfaction.)
[BALANCE] Made pawns less likely to engage in necrophilia when sated.
[BALANCE] Added vulnerability modifiers to a few core traits (Wimp, Tough, Masochist,..)
[FEATURE] Added crocodilian penis for some animal species. (Alligator, crocodile, quinkana, sarcosuchus, etc)
[CORE] Consolidated common sex checks into a single thinknode (ThinkNode_ConditionalSexChecks), which makes it easier to include/update important checks for various jobs.
[CORE] Removed dummy privates, wrote a new comp for automatically adding genitalia when the pawn is spawned. Far faster than the old method of doing it. Should be compatible with old saves, though some weirdness may occur.
[CORE] Added a basic but functional sexuality tracker (similar to Kinsey scale) to the above comp. Currently hidden from players and not actually used in calculations, just included as a proof of concept.
[FIX] Added some null checks.
[FIX] Removed a bad check from CP rape, should now work at intended frequency.
[FIX] Some thinktree fixes for pawns that don't need to eat.
[BALANCE] Made pawns less likely to engage in zoophilia if they have a partner. Unless the partner is an animal (there's mods for that).
[BALANCE] Made pawns slightly less likely to engage in necrophilia if they have a partner.

[FIX] Whorin' wasn't triggering properly.
[FIX] Other miscellaneous fixes to the whorin' checks. They should now properly give freebies to colonists that they like.
[FIX] Fixed forced handjob text.
[FIX] Removed unnecessary can_be_fucked check from whores. With the new sex system, there's always something that a whore can do, such as handjobs or oral.
[FIX] Restored RandomRape job. Only used by pawns with Rapist trait. Trigger frequency might need tuning.
[FIX] Alien races were using human lifespan when determining sex frequency. Scaled it to their actual lifespan.
[FIX] Enabled determine pregnancy for futas and aliens with non-standard life stages.
[FIX] Patched in animal recipes. Sterlization and such should now work for most mod-added animals.
[FIX] Animal-on-animal should no longer target animals outside of allowed zones.
[CORE] Cleaned up some of the old unused configs and old redundant code. Still much left to do.
[BALANCE] Adjusted bestiality chances. Pawns with no prior experience in bestiality are less likely to engage in it for the first time. And pawns who lack the Zoophile trait will attempt to find other outlets first.
[BALANCE] Same for necrophilia: pawns are far less likely to engage in necrophilia for the first time.
[BALANCE] Males are less likely to rim or fist during straight sex.
[BALANCE] Adjusted trait effects on CP rape. Bloodlust trait now only affects frequency if rape beating is enabled. Removed the gender factor which made females rape less, now it depends on traits.
[BALANCE] Pawns are more likely to fap if they're alone.
[FEATURE] Added new settings that allow visitors and animals to rape comfort prisoners if enabled.
[FEATURE] Added a sex drive stat (in Social category), which affects how quickly the sex need decays. Among other things, this means that old pawns no longer get as easily frustrated by lack of sex. Some traits affect sex drive: Nymphomaniac raises it, Ascetic and Prude (from Psychology) lower it.
[FEATURE] If a pawn is trying to rape a relative, it's now mentioned in the alert.

Ed86:

add vagina operations for males -> futa
fixes for rape CP, breeder helper

v1.9.2
Zaltys:
Fixed a bug in baby generation which allowed animals to get a hediff meant for human babies. Also clarified the hediff name, since 'child not working' could be mistaken as an error.
Improved logging for forced handjobs.
Fixed necrophilia error from trying to violate corpses that don't rot (mechanoids, weird mod-added creatures such as summons, etc).
Disallowed female zoos from taking wild animals to bed, because letting them inside the base can be problematic (and most can't get past doors anyway).
Fixed incorrect colonist-on-animal thoughts.
Whores now try to refrain from random fappin' (so they can spend more time servicing visitors/colonists), unless they're sexually frustrated.
Added a pregnancy filter for races that cannot get pregnant (undead, etc). '
Colonists with Kind trait are less likely to rape.
Added trait inheritance for [SYR] Individuality and Westerado traits.
Added fail reasons to targeted Comfort Prisoner rape (on right-click); it has so many checks that it was often unclear why it wouldn't work.Added udders for animals (where appropriate, such as cows and muffalos), and a 'featureless chest' type for non-mammalian humanoids.
Removed breasts from various non-mammalian animals, mostly reptiles and avians. Checked most of the common mods, but probably missed some animals. If you spot any species that have mammaries when they shouldn't, report them in the thread so they can be fixed.

v1.9.1
Zaltys:
Rewrote the processSex functionality, which fixes several old bugs (no more oral-only) and allows for much wider variety of sex. Merged animals into the same function. Some of the messages might have the initiator and receiver mixed up, please leave feedback if you notice any oddness.
Centralized the ticks-to-next-lovin' increase and satisfy into afterSex, to ensure that those aren't skipped.
Changed Comfort Prisoner Rape from Wardening to BasicWorker. Because it being in Wardening meant that pawns incapable of Social could never do it.
Added support for Alien Humanoid Framework 2.0 traits. Xenophobes are less attracted to alien species, and xenophiles less attracted to their own species.
Made zoophiles less attracted to humanlikes, and reluctant to pay for humanoid whores.
Added basic age scaling for non-human races with long lifespans, when determining attraction.
Enabled cum splatter from solo acts. Lowered cleaning time for cum to balance the increased output.
Added new thoughts for BestialityForFemale job, for the rare cases where the female lacks the zoophile trait. Non-zoos almost never do that job, but it can happen if they have no other outlets. Previously this counted as 'raped by animal' and massive mood loss, even though initiated by the colonist.
Set the min-ticks-to-next-lovin' counter lower for insects on generation.
Whores lacked a tick check and could instantly jump from one job to another. Forced them to recover a bit between jobs, but not as long as regular pawns. Also changed the sex type balance for whoring: handjobs and fellatio are more common in whoring than in other job types.
Lesbian sex lacked variety. Added fingering and scissoring to the available sex types.
Added mutual masturbation and fisting.
Added settings for sex type frequency, so you can lower the frequency of ones you don't want to see. Lowering the vanilla sex (vaginal and anal) is not recommended, makes things go weird.
Added interspecies animal-on-animal breeding. Setting disabled by default.
Added setting for necrophilia, disabled by default.
Disabled the 'observed corpse' debuff for necros.
Text fixes for logging.
Added text variation to make some types clearer.

v1.9.0c
Zaltys:
Patched in nearly hundred sexual conversation topics. Currently set as rare, so pawns don't talk about sex all the day.
Small fix that should stop babies from inheriting conflicting trait combos.
Disabled the 'allowed me to get raped' thoughts for animal-on-female if the target is a zoophile. Didn't seem right that they'd hate the bystanders, despite getting a mood bonus from it.
Fixed a stupid mistake in the trait inheritance checking. Didn't break anything, but it certainly didn't work either.
Fixed the whoring target selection and spam.

Ed86:
switched Genital_Helper to public class
crawls under christmas tree with bottle of vodka and salad, waiting for presents

v1.9.0b
Zaltys:
Reset the ticks at sexualization, so generated pawns (esp. animals) don't always start lovin' as their first action.
Couple of fixes to memories/thoughts, those could generate rare errors on female-on-animal. Also required for any animal-on-animal that might get added later.
Added a simpler way of checking if an another mod is loaded. Works regardless of load order.
Renamed abstract bases to avoid overwriting vanilla ones, to fix some mod conflicts if RJW is not loaded last. (Loading it last is still advisable, but not everyone pays attention to that..)

preg fix

v1.9.0
Zaltys:
Fixed the motes for bestiality. Which also fixes the 'wild animals don't always consent'-functionality.
Added functions for checking prude and lecher traits (from other mods).
Added patches for some conflicting traits (no more prude or asexual nymphos, etc).
Added couple of low-impact thoughts for whoring attempts.
Used the thoughts to make sure that a whore doesn't constantly bother same visitors or colonists.
Enabled hook up attempts for prisoners, since they already have thoughttree for that. Most likely to try to target other prisoners or warden, whoever is around.
Refactored JobGiver_Bestiality: removed redundant code and improved speed. Also improved target picking further, and made it so that drunk or high colonists may make unwise choices when picking targets.

-Whoring is now determined by designation not by bed. Whorebeds not buildable anymore.
-Whoring designation works on prisoners.
-Added unhappy thoughts on whoring (diminishes with experience). Some backstories (defined in Defs/SpecialBackstories.xml) count as a lot of experience. Prisoners get different more severe mood hit.
-Now there is special gizmo, that encompasses all the designations, clicking on its subelements alters the settings for all selected pawns. 
-Added animal designation used to select beasts that are allowed to use breeding designated pawns.
-Added mod setting toggles for enabling zoophilia and for enabling weird cross-species pregnancies.
-Added max search radius for a whore (equals 100 tiles) they won't try clients further away from them.

v1.6.3a_rwg
-fixed bug in designator drawing now it is possible to play with mod
-Added adoption (Claim Child operation). If you see any child laying around, you don't need to trouble yourself with warden persuation. You can designate child for this operation and it will be included in your faction right away.
This is doen as surgery operation and requires medicine (but doesn't fail).  I cannot get it work otherwise, chadcode just shits some unintelligible errors happening a dozen calls away from the mod code. Consider the med requirement an adoption census.
v1.6.3_rwg
Anonimous release
-Fixed broken body hediff to give the mood offsets as it should. 
(btw, if someone didn't understand that, it probably be broken mind, but the meaning was lost in translation by original author)
-Reworked pregnancy. 
It is now even more compatible with Children and Pregnacy mod. If the latter is acitve, its pregnancy system is used if possible. Otherwise, rjw simpler pregnancy is used. 
-RJW pregnancy works for any pair of humanlike pawns. There are settings determining the race of the resulting child.
-RJW pregnancy defines the child at the moment of conception. Loading saves should not reroll the newborn.
-Added menu toggle to deactivate human-animal pregnancy (why would anyone need that? It's boring.)
-Added animal equivalent of designate for comfort. Animals beat prisoners less often.
-Animals born from human mothers receive random training in varied skills up to half of their max training. 
-Animal babies use different relation than normal children, if the animal dies its human parent doesn't get as significant debuff as with human child. 
-Fixed (probably?) fathers disappearing from child relations due to garbage collection . At least inheritance information is now preserved for sure. Does not apply to CnP, but it wasn't probably affected much anyway (due to both parents typically staying in the game for longer than ordinary raider). 

v1.6.2_rwg
Anonimous release
-Added "submit" combat ability. Makes colonist lay down and stop resistance. Colonist is incapacitated for 1-2 hours.
If you rescue them, the effect disappears right away. (Being little sissies they are, they won't dismount themselves off strong arms of their savior unless you make them to.)
Make sure that nearby enemies are only metaphorically after your meat. Check mod settings in options if you don't see the button.
