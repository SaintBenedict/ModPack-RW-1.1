Greetings, colonists!

Do you know that installing conventional bionic parts to pawns actually reduce their total health? (Explanation by Medical System Expansion)

Do you want something fresh with your OP Bionic setup?

Well, say no more!

Our top scientists have discovered a way to make bionic parts more durable on pawns. They dubbed it the "Elite Bionics Framework".

Working together with the engineers down the university alley, the team successfully completed the "Elite Archotech" project and reconfigured the Archotech Bionics to be more durable.

Both the Framework and the Archotech are now available for all to use. Get them here:

Note to general users: Elite Archotech depends on Elite Bionics Framework. The mod order auto-sort should be able to help you out on this.

Other known mods that make use of Elite Bionics Framework (not guaranteed to be a complete list):

Note to modders: you may apply a flat buff or a percentage buff to body part max HP through hediffs that use the Elite Bionics Framework.

Good luck in real life and on the Rim!
