	<description>Boreal forest is a biome drastically needing some new, unique animals. With this module, you can see famous american black bears - smaller cousins of the grizzly bears, as well as arctic coyotes and tiny otters.

Vanilla Animals Expanded is a modular mod. It means it will come out in several modules allowing people to subscribe to only the animals they want in the game. This part is the Boreal Forest biome expansion. It adds 3 new animals that will spawn in the Boreal Forest, but some of them also spawn in other biomes. They have vanilla artwork, sounds and balancing.
