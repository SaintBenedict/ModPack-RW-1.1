	<description>After having my first Spaceship launch in the tropical rainforest biome, I have noticed it actually didn’t feel as tropical as I would like it to feel. Monkeys, tortoises, an elephant here and there, it doesn’t really give away that unique, diverse environment vibe. Sarg and I have decided to expand on it with a range of new, unique animals, which include gorillas and mandrills - possibly the most “jungle” animals there are. It is absolutely possible to tame your own army of tigers and send them off to hunt down the enemies, just as it is possible to have a peaceful tapir farm on the outskirts of the jungle!

Vanilla Animals Expanded is a modular mod. It means it will come out in several modules allowing people to subscribe to only the animals they want in the game. This part is the Tropical Rainforest biome expansion. It adds 6 new animals that will spawn in the Tropical Rainforest, but some of them also spawn in other biomes. They have vanilla artwork, sounds and balancing.</description>
