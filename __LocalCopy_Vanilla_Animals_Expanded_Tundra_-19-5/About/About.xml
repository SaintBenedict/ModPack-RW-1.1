	<description>Tundra biome always felt devoid of any actual unique animals. With this module, we have introduced Musk oxen and a moose - a beautiful symbol of Canada, which can be milked every couple of days just like an already existing in the game Elk. Porcupines are tiny rodents, similar in a lot of ways to Capybaras, with sharp quills used to repel predators. Beware of the Megawolverines though! They are genetically modified experiment out of control, by many described as just large balls of fur and claws. Taming one could be a challenge, but having one ready for combat is a huge advantage.

Vanilla Animals Expanded is a modular mod. It means it will come out in several modules allowing people to subscribe to only the animals they want in the game. This part is the Tundra biome expansion. It adds 4 new animals that will spawn in the Tundra, but some of them also spawn in other biomes. They have vanilla artwork, sounds and balancing.
