  <description>Beer is Alright.

I was playing a game with tons of beer and set my colonists to have three a day to see the effect. In two months half my people had cirrosis. Kinda overkill I think.

I decided to turn it down so three a day won't kill you by adjusting down dosage severity, and tolerance to addict. Everything else is the same and can happen in larger amounts, diseases, withdrawals etc.. 

Compatibility - Should be completely. This tiny MOD uses xpath patching and overwrites no core files.

Version 1.0 - Release
