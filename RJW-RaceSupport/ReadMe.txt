Plans :
Add more parts and races to support
Include mod links inside the Race Support files and the LoversLab page

JecsTools and Multiplayer Related:
For Multiplayer just delete the file in RJWRaceSupport\Defs\ThingDefs\Items_Apparel. without this file you should avoid an error due to not having JecsTools.
Alternatively  if you don't use JecsTools do the above as well.
