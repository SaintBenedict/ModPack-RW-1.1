Vanilla Apparel Expanded is part of a series of mods expanding on everyday life on the Rimworld. When paired together with a brand new Vanilla Weapons Expanded and Vanilla Armours Expanded, you can bring something to your game that will keep you interested in it for days.

Apparel is distributed into several new technologies that need to be researched, expanding the life of the game and possibly leading to some interesting choices - research a way to get off this planet? Or maybe learn how to craft jeans and workwear?

This mod adds a wide selection of apparel with useful effects, including but not limited to:
Gas masks protecting from toxicity;
Jumpsuits and aprons for work speed boost;
Doctor scrubs and Chefâ€™s uniforms.
