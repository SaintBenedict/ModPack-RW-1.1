	<description>Tropical swamp never really had this “oh, this zone is dangerous” feel. It felt just like any other swamp. This very module, albeit only adding 3 new animals, is our way to remedy this. Alligators and Anacondas will now actively hunt in the tropical swamp biome, and they are a force to be reckoned with. To ease things up, we have also added Indian elephants - smaller versions of their african counterparts, with no tusks that can be sold. They are significantly easier to hunt and tame, and are a useful pack animal.

Vanilla Animals Expanded is a modular mod. It means it will come out in several modules allowing people to subscribe to only the animals they want in the game. This part is the Tropical Swamp biome expansion. It adds 3 new animals that will spawn in the Tropical Swamp, but some of them also spawn in other biomes. They have vanilla artwork, sounds and balancing.
