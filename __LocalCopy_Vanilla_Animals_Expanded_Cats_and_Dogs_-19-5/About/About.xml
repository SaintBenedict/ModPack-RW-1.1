	<description>Vanilla Animals Expanded is a modular mod. It means it will come out in several modules allowing people to subscribe to only the animals they want in the game. This part is the Cats and Dogs variant. This mod adds 21 new breeds of dogs and cats to perfectly fit vanilla game, with custom vanilla artwork, sounds and balancing. With this variant you are finally able to send your maine coons on the enemies, run a farm with an old german shepherd or run a dog show with all your sweet poodles.
