	<description>Vanilla Animals Expanded is a modular mod. It means it will come out in several modules allowing people to subscribe to only the animals they want in the game. This part is the Extreme Desert biome expansion. It adds 3 new animals that will spawn in the Extreme Desert, but some of them also spawn in other biomes. They have vanilla artwork, sounds and balancing.</description>
