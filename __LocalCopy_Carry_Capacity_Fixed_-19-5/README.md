# Carry_Capacity_Fixed
The behavior of carry capacity for pawns is 35 kg multiplied by a body type multiplier. This mod aims to change that. Pawns will now be able to hold more in inventory, as well as increase caravan capacity. This mod effects animals and colonists.
Suggested to use with "Pick Up And Haul".
