&lt;size=20&gt;Description&lt;/size&gt;
Allows your colonists to remember their position during base defense. You can send off your colonists to their positions with a single click.
		
&lt;size=20&gt;How to use&lt;/size&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Set defensive positions for colonists&lt;/b&gt;
1) Draft your defenders and place them where you want them.
2) With your defenders selected, right-click the Defensive position button and select "Save defensive position".
Done. The selected colonists will remember their held positions.

&lt;b&gt;Send colonists to saved positions&lt;/b&gt;
1) Select your defenders.
2) Click the Defensive position button (or press T).
Your defenders will be drafted and will run to their saved positions.

&lt;b&gt;Advanced mode&lt;/b&gt;
Hold the Alt key and click the Defensive position button to switch between basic and advanced mode.
Advanced mode works exactly like Basic, but you have 4 positions to work with. Save a position using the right-click menu, then click the slot to send the selected colonists to the position they have been assigned under that number.
Pressing T is the same as clicking the first slot.

&lt;b&gt;Squad hotkeys&lt;/b&gt;
Colonists can be assigned to squads for easier selection. To assign, hold the Ctrl key and press 1-9 on the numeric keypad to assign the squad to that key. Press the numeric key of a squad to select the squad members, press again to focus on the squad location.

&lt;b&gt;Utility hotkeys&lt;/b&gt;
There are three other keys on the keypad for quick colonist management: press period to select all colonists on the map, undraft everyone by pressing divide, and press zero to send all colonists to their assigned defensive position.
In the Options &gt; Mod Options window you can switch the Shift key from saving positions to queuing movement orders.
